# System Overview

## Filesystem Hierarchy Standard \(FHS\)

Windows, Mac, and UNIX are three of the most widely used operating systems today. Each of these operating systems contain their own set of standards and guidelines of programs running on their platform.

In Linux, this standard enables:

* Software to predict the location of installed files and directories, and
* Users to predict the location of installed files and directories.
