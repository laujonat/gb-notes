### Internet Protocol version 4 \([**IPv4**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4)**\)**

The fourth revision of the Internet Protocol \(IP\) used to identify devices on a network through an addressing system.

### Internet Protocol version 6 \([**IPv6**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6_address)**\)**

* IPv6 is the successor to Internet Protocol Version 4 \(IPv4\). 
* Designed as an evolutionary upgrade to the Internet Protocol and will.
* Aims to provide the infrastructure to allow the Internet to grow steadily, both in terms of the number of hosts connected and the total amount of data traffic transmitted.

### **Transmission Control Protocol \(**[**TCP**](https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/TCP)**\)**

* Uses a set of rules to exchange messages with other Internet points at the information packet level.

### **User Datagram Protocol \(**[**UDP**](https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/UDP-User-Datagram-Protocol)**\)**

* Acts as an alternative communication protocol to TCP and is used to establish low-latency and loss-tolerant connections between applications and the Internet.

### **Internet Protocol \(**[**IP**](https://searchunifiedcommunications.techtarget.com/definition/Internet-Protocol)**\)**

* Set of rules to send and receive messages at the Internet address level.
* Uniquely identifies a host from all other computers on the internet

### **Hypertext Transfer Protocol \(**[**HTTP**](https://searchwindevelopment.techtarget.com/definition/HTTP)**\) ``**

  * Each command is executed independently, without any knowledge of the commands that came before it.

### **Hypertext Transfer Protocol \(**[**HTTPS**](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-https/)**\)** 

HTTPS uses an encryption protocol to encrypt communications. 

The protocol is called Transport Layer Security\(TLS\), although formerly it was known as Secure Sockets Layer \(SSL\)

### **Transport Layer Security \(**[**TLS**](https://www.networkworld.com/article/2303073/lan-wan-what-is-transport-layer-security-protocol.html)**\)**

TLS handshake protocol enables the client and server to authenticate each other and to negotiate security keys before any data is transmitted.

### **File Transfer Protocol \(**[**FTP**](https://searchenterprisewan.techtarget.com/definition/File-Transfer-Protocol)**\)**

* **Stateful** __Protocol
  * The client establishes a Control Connection __for the duration of an FTP session that typically spans multiple data transfers.
  * Standard for transfer of files and records over a TCP/IP network
