The actual process for changing your default shell from Bash to ZSH is extremely easy. Just run `chsh -s /bin/zsh`.

> _**Note**_ that you'll need to supply the correct path your ZSH binary which you can get with the `which zsh` command we used earlier. [Click here](https://linux.die.net/man/1/chsh) for more information on the `chsh` command.
